# Fixes Applied - Development Setup & Atlas Error Resolution

## Date: October 13, 2025

## Changes Summary

### 1. Local Development Port Standardization

**Problem:** The project was running on multiple different ports (1124, 8124, 8010) making development inconsistent.

**Solution:** Standardized local development to always use port 3000 with automatic process cleanup.

**Files Modified:**
- [package.json](package.json) - Updated dev scripts
- [scripts/kill-port.js](scripts/kill-port.js) - Created port management utility
- [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md) - Updated documentation
- [LOCAL_DEVELOPMENT.md](LOCAL_DEVELOPMENT.md) - Created comprehensive guide

**New Commands:**
```bash
npm run dev              # Run on port 3000 (auto-kills existing process)
npm run dev:vercel       # Run with Vercel environment on port 3000
npm run dev:legacy       # Run on legacy port 1124 if needed
```

### 2. Atlas Chat Widget Styled-Components Error Fix

**Problem:** Atlas chat widget was causing a styled-components error in development:
```
Error: An error occurred. See https://github.com/styled-components/styled-components/blob/main/packages/styled-components/src/utils/errors.md#17
```

This error (#17) means: "CSSStyleSheet could not be found on HTMLStyleElement" - the Atlas widget's internal styled-components were interfering with the application's style management.

**Root Cause:**
- Atlas widget uses styled-components internally
- Loading strategy caused conflicts with Next.js SSR and style sheet management
- Widget initialization timing issues during hydration

**Solutions Implemented:**

#### A. Improved Loading Strategy
- Changed Atlas script loading from `afterInteractive` to `lazyOnload`
- Added error boundaries around Atlas initialization
- Deferred Atlas initialization using `requestIdleCallback`
- Added proper DOM ready checks before initialization

#### B. Development Toggle (Recommended)
Added environment variable to disable Atlas in development mode:

**Files Modified:**
- [.env.local](.env.local) - Added `NEXT_PUBLIC_ENABLE_ATLAS=false`
- [next.config.mjs](next.config.mjs) - Added to runtime config
- [pages/_app.js](pages/_app.js) - Updated Atlas loading logic

**Usage:**
```bash
# In .env.local
NEXT_PUBLIC_ENABLE_ATLAS=false   # Disable Atlas (no errors in dev)
NEXT_PUBLIC_ENABLE_ATLAS=true    # Enable Atlas (for testing chat widget)
```

### 3. Port Management Utility

**Created:** [scripts/kill-port.js](scripts/kill-port.js)

**Features:**
- Cross-platform support (macOS, Linux, Windows)
- Handles multiple processes on the same port
- Clear console feedback
- Error handling for edge cases

**Usage:**
```bash
node scripts/kill-port.js 3000    # Kill process on port 3000
node scripts/kill-port.js 8080    # Kill process on any port
```

### 4. Vercel Local Development Support

**New Script:** `npm run dev:vercel`

**Benefits:**
- Runs with Vercel's exact serverless environment
- Automatically syncs environment variables from Vercel project
- Tests edge functions and middleware locally
- Simulates production deployment environment

**Setup:**
```bash
# One-time setup
vercel link                       # Link to your Vercel project
vercel env pull .env.local        # Pull environment variables

# Daily usage
npm run dev:vercel                # Run with Vercel environment
```

## Testing Results

### Before Fixes:
- ❌ Styled-components error on every page load
- ❌ "Port already in use" errors requiring manual cleanup
- ❌ Inconsistent port usage across different commands

### After Fixes:
- ✅ No styled-components errors (Atlas disabled in dev)
- ✅ Automatic port cleanup on every dev start
- ✅ Consistent development on port 3000
- ✅ Option to enable Atlas when needed for testing
- ✅ Vercel local development support

## Console Errors Remaining

The following warnings are informational and do not affect functionality:

1. **Google Maps Places API Deprecation Warning**
   - Not a breaking error
   - Google Maps AutocompleteService still works
   - Migration to AutocompleteSuggestion recommended (future task)

2. **SVG Path Attribute Warning**
   - Minor React warning about SVG path formatting
   - Does not affect rendering or functionality

## Recommendations

### For Daily Development:
```bash
npm run dev                       # Standard development (Atlas disabled)
```

### For Testing Chat Widget:
```bash
# 1. Enable Atlas in .env.local
NEXT_PUBLIC_ENABLE_ATLAS=true

# 2. Restart dev server
npm run dev
```

### For Production-like Testing:
```bash
npm run dev:vercel                # Test with Vercel environment
```

## Additional Documentation

- [LOCAL_DEVELOPMENT.md](./LOCAL_DEVELOPMENT.md) - Complete local development guide
- [CLAUDE.md](./CLAUDE.md) - Updated project documentation

## Notes

- The styled-components error was specific to the Atlas widget's internal implementation
- Disabling Atlas in development doesn't affect production builds
- Atlas will still load in production when `NEXT_PUBLIC_ENABLE_ATLAS` is not set or set to any value other than 'false'
- All production deployments remain unchanged
