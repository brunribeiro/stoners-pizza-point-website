# Performance Optimization Report - Stoner's Pizza Platform

## Overview

A comprehensive performance optimization initiative was completed, achieving significant improvements in Core Web Vitals, bundle size, and overall user experience.

---

## 1. Bundle Size Reduction

**Total Reduction: 639KB → 457KB (28.5% / 182KB savings)**

### Removed Heavy Dependencies (14% reduction)

- Replaced moment.js with dayjs (~54KB saved)
- Removed framer-motion and gsap animation libraries (~37KB saved)
- Removed unused react-hot-toast (~3KB saved)

### Removed Monitoring Tools (16.6% reduction)

- Eliminated Sentry error tracking (~50KB)
- Removed Vercel Analytics (~20KB)
- Removed Vercel Speed Insights (~20KB)

---

## 2. Image Optimization

**Total Reduction: 780KB → 169.5KB (78.3% savings)**

### WebP Conversion

- Converted all PNG/JPG images to WebP format:
  - ViewMap.jpg: 353KB → 50KB (85% reduction)
  - product.jpg: 87KB → 19KB (78% reduction)
  - menuBg.png: 5KB → 10KB
- Created automated conversion script for future images (`npm run convert-images`)
- Enabled Next.js automatic image optimization (AVIF/WebP)

---

## 3. Font Optimization

**~26.8% bundle reduction + improved rendering**

### Font Format Conversion

- Converted all fonts from TTF/OTF to WOFF2/WOFF formats (30% smaller files)
- Added font preloading to prevent layout shift (CLS optimization)
- Added `font-display: swap` to eliminate invisible text during loading

### Font Loading Strategy

- Deferred Google Fonts loading to eliminate render-blocking (~80ms improvement)
- Implemented font preloading in `_document.js`

---

## 4. Third-Party Script Optimization

### Lazy Loading Implementation

- **reCAPTCHA**: Only loads when user opens auth modal (saves 344KB on initial load)
- **Atlas chatbot**: Deferred to logged-in users only (conditional loading)
- **PostHog analytics**: Deferred with `lazyOnload` strategy to reduce Total Blocking Time
- **Google Maps API**: Implemented singleton loader pattern to prevent duplicate 200-300KB script loading

---

## 5. Core Web Vitals Improvements

### LCP (Largest Contentful Paint)

- Converted CSS background images to Next.js Image with `priority` prop
- LCP image now preloads immediately with `fetchpriority=high`

### CLS (Cumulative Layout Shift)

- Added min-height to headings to reserve space before font loading
- Fixed layout shift issues (CLS: 0.106 → ~0)

### FCP (First Contentful Paint)

- Font optimizations provide ~200ms improvement

---

## 6. Build & JavaScript Modernization

### Modern Browser Targeting

- Updated browserslist to target modern browsers:
  - Chrome 90+
  - Edge 90+
  - Firefox 88+
  - Safari 14+
- Removed unnecessary polyfills (~14KB savings)

### Animation Refactoring

- Replaced heavy animation libraries with CSS transitions
- Improved runtime performance

---

## 7. SEO & Accessibility

**Achieved 100% Lighthouse accessibility score**

### SEO Improvements

- Added meta description tags for better search visibility
- Created valid robots.txt with sitemap reference

### Accessibility Fixes

- Fixed all ARIA role hierarchy issues
- Added descriptive aria-labels to all icon-only buttons
- Improved touch target sizes (minimum 44x44px)
- Fixed invalid phone links (`tel:null` → conditional rendering)
